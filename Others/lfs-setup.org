* How to set-up git-lfs

LFS means large file storage. Github does not allow to upload big files so to have big files in our repository, we need git-lfs. To set it up,


1. Goto packagecloud.io/github/git-lfs/install and follow the commands.
2. Now install git-lfs using "sudo apt install git-lfs"
3. Now initialize git-lfs for your account using "git lfs install"
4. Now to track big files in some repository using LFS, go to that repository and type 
	git lfs track '*pdf' 
5. Then normally use git,
	git add --all
	git commit -m "testing lfs"
	git push
And you are done!
