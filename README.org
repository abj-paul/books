* About
All academic books I read are stored here. As I read them in home and in university, version controlling is needed. Thats why this repository was formed.
* Syntax
I follow this scheme from 15th October, 22.

Red = definitions
Black = Read once
Green = Read many times, important
Orange = Keyword
Empty Black Box = Interesting to read but not important
